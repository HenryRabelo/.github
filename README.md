### What is included
This is a personal repository of the special GitHub files that will be included by default in all repositories.

While most of these files are usually used by bigger organizations and communities, they will be adapted to serve all of my personal projects and repositories.

The idea is simply to include as many of the special files and templates supported by GitHub as possible, so interactions under my projects are as well organized and defined as possible.
